# PayTogether

A group payment authorization app where **no one gets charged unless everyone agrees**.

## The Problem

Splitting bills with friends is awkward. Someone pays upfront, then has to chase everyone for money. People forget. Venmo requests pile up. Friendships get strained over $20.

## The Solution

PayTogether uses **all-or-nothing conditional authorization**:
1. Host creates a payment lobby and sets a deadline
2. Everyone authorizes their portion upfront
3. Payment only processes if **everyone** commits by the deadline
4. If even one person doesn't authorize, **nobody gets charged**

No awkward money requests. No chasing friends. Just simple, fair group payments.

## Features

✅ **All-or-nothing payment logic** - Everyone commits or nobody pays  
✅ **No app download required** - Works via shareable link in browser  
✅ **Receipt scanning** - Auto-itemize costs from receipt photos  
✅ **Multiple payment methods** - Venmo, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay  
✅ **Real-time tracking** - See who's authorized instantly  
✅ **Host controls** - Extend deadlines, send reminders, manage participants  
✅ **Push notifications** - Automatic reminders as deadline approaches  
✅ **Custom or even splits** - Flexible payment amounts
